TheHen
======

TheHen is a toolkit for bootstrapping and developing  *[Kloudstores](http://www.kloudstores.com)* themes in a tidy environment using Sass.

TheHen represents a neatly organized source folder with clean and simple scaffolding (base template files, SCSS files, and theme options).

Why use TheHen?
---------------

TheHen accelerates development by giving you access to Sass. Sass is much quicker and cleaner to code, but still compile to normal CSS and JavaScript.


Built with Foundation 4 + Sass + Compass
----------------------------------------

Yes, I'm a huge fan of *[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com)*'s!

I do also love Sass, therefore I combined these two passions into kind of a solid base to develop the 'thehen' on.
